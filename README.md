# Object-Detection-with-YOLOv3

In this repository I implemented objects detection with yolov3

requirements: opencv 3.3 or above versions(opencv 3.2 or latest are not supported), you can coco.names file and yolov3 cfg 

in the yolo-coco folder in this repo. But the weights file (yolov3.weights) need to be downloaded on this link:

https://pjreddie.com/darknet/yolo/ .

Note that the names and cfg files can also be downloaded from this link.

The following Images are output of the images located in the images folders in this repo
